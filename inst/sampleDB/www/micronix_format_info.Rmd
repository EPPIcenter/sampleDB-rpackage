## Micronix Data File Formating

To cut down on time spent renaming columns, aside from the default format, SampleDB accepts Micronix Data in two additional formats:

1. Traxcer Format
2. VisionMate Format

### Traxcer Format

- SampleDB expects the first line of the traxcer format to be a plate barcode line. This line will be skipped during uploads.
- The `Row` and `Column` storage information columns are combined into a column named `Position`.
- The `Barcode` column is named `Tube ID`.

### VisionMate Format

- The `Row` column is named `LocationRow`.
- The `Column` column is named `LocationColumn`.
- The `Barcode` column is named `TubeCode`.

### Blank CSV Rows
  
  Rows that do not have 10 digit integer barcodes are skipped
