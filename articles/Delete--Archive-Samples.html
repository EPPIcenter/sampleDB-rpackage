<blockquote>
<p>Release Note: While archived samples will persist in the database,
unarchiving is still in development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> In addition to keeping track of locations,
sample state and status should be kept to keep a history of all wet lab
specimens in the lab.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-5-status-of-db">The 5 status’ of DB<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-5-status-of-db"></a>
</h3>
<p>Once a sample has been uploaded to SampleDB there are <u>5</u>
statuses it can be in:</p>
<p><strong>In use. (Default).</strong> The sample must have a location
on a plate.</p>
<p><strong>Exhausted (empty).</strong> The physical sample tube has been
thrown away because there is no sample left. In SampleDB, it no longer
needs to have a location on a plate. But SampleDB needs to keep the
Micronix Barcode, Study Subject, Date, StudyCode, SpecimenType so that
we can retrospectively link the Micronix Barcode to the sample metadata.
The user should be able to see that it is empty/ depleted/ whatever term
we want to use so that it is clear that it cannot be used again in the
future.</p>
<p><strong>Bad.</strong> The physical sample tube has been thrown away
because there is something wrong with the sample. For example, bacterial
growth, left at room temp, etc. As with an empty sample, SampleDB no
longer needs to have a location but does need to keep Micronix Barcode,
Study Subject, Date, StudyCode, SpecimenType so that we can
retrospectively link the Micronix Barcode to the sample metadata. The
user should be able to see that it is "bad.” It would be great to also
include a brief description of why it was marked bad in “comment.”</p>
<p><strong>Missing:</strong> This is useful as a temporary status to
flag samples that cannot be found. This is by no means a final status;
missing samples should be searched and their status updated.</p>
<p><strong>Shipped:</strong> In some cases, samples need to be
distributed to other labs and collaborators. This status helps keep
track of which samples have been sent to others.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="archiving-samples">Archiving samples<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#archiving-samples"></a>
</h3>
<p>Archiving samples, e.g. changing from “In Use” to Exhausted, Bad,
Missing, or Shipped:</p>
<p>To modify the status of your samples, open the “Search, Delete &amp;
Archive Samples” panel and search for your samples using any of the
aforementioned search techniques (by plate, by study subject ID, by
barcode, etc. as detailed under “Search Samples.” Once completed, select
the rows in the table of the samples you wish to modify. A selected row
will be highlighted with light blue. To unselect, click on the
highlighted rows. Choose the status of the ALL selected samples with the
“Status” dropdown below the table. Finally, click on the panel tab on
the bottom right hand of the screen and press the “Archive Samples
button. This will present all selected samples for you to review before
final archival. You will be required to enter a status for the samples
listed. You may optionally add a comment to the selected samples using
the”Comment” field. You can cancel if something does not look correct to
you by clicking outside of the dialog or closing the dialog box.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="deleting-samples-or-plates">Deleting samples or plates<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#deleting-samples-or-plates"></a>
</h3>
<p>Delete is used only when a sample(s) or plate(s) were uploaded
incorrectly. It is a <strong>PERMANENT</strong> decision and cannot be
undone and should not be used unless you are fixing an upload error. You
can search for samples to delete by barcode (single, or a file with
multiple barcodes) or by plate name. Once you have selected your
erroneous samples, click on the panel tab on the bottom right hand of
the screen and press the “Delete Samples” button. This will present all
selected samples for you to review before final deletion. You can cancel
if something does not look correct to you by clicking outside of the
dialog or closing the dialog box.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="delete-archive-controls">Delete &amp; Archive Controls<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#delete-archive-controls"></a>
</h3>
<p>The process for deleting &amp; archiving controls is identical to
samples, with the exception of dried blood spots because they are stored
in collections and not an individual tube. You should first identify the
blood spots you want to modify (e.g., SheetID &amp; BagName,
Composition, Percentage, Density). Once done, select the collection and
select ‘Archive Samples’ or ‘Delete Samples’ as you would do for
samples. The dialog that appears will give you a numeric input for each
collection to update the number of spots you will delete or archive.
Once done, select ‘Delete’ or ‘Archive’ to commit your changes. If you
are deleting spots, this will <em>decrease</em> the number of ‘Total’
spots by the number you entered for that collection. If you are
archiving spots, this will <em>increase</em> the number of ‘Exhausted’
spots by the number you entered. These changes will be visible the next
time you search for this collection.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> When archiving spots, you have the option
to set a status, just like in samples. The ‘Exhausted’ status is
reserved for when a spot is punched, which is used automatically by the
system when extractions are recorded.</p>
<p>If you archive spots, this will automatically put those spots in an
‘Archive’ state and assign them the ‘Status’ you set. You can find those
spots using the State and Status filters in the search panel.</p>
