The cryovial upload workflow is quite similar to micronix uploads, but
there are some differences in requirements and validation checks. To
start, cryovials are often shipped to the lab in boxes. These boxes may
be able to be scanned, but we currently cannot scan all of the tubes
together as we can with micronix tubes (eg. using the traxcer scanner).
Cryovials also do not always have barcodes, and they may not always be
unique. We therefore have a different set of requirements for cryovials
in our uploads.

### Steps to Upload Cryovials

#### Verify that the physical samples & sample metadata align

When we receive a shipment, we should receive a manifest of
the contents in the box. Either scan the barcodes, or do some spot
checks to ensure the order aligns with your map.

#### Build CSV and upload

At the upload interface, choose "Samples" under "Choose Your Upload
Type", and "Cryovial" under "Sample Storage Type". Download the template
by selecting "Download" in the main page Enter the information you have
into the provided headers (refer to "*Modify CSV file to include all
metadata"* for more information about the headers). Make sure the date
format is "YYYY-MM-DD" for all entries under CollectionDate. Finally,
save the document as a CSV.

### Validation for Cryovials

Cryovials have some similar validation checks as micronix samples. For
example, a tube cannot be placed in the same location as an existing,
active tube. The positions must also have letters as rows - this can
introduce some confusion as manifests may use numbers instead, so you
will want to convert the numbers to letters. There are also tests
applied that are unique to cryovials that are in place due to the
different constraints of cryovials (barcodes may or may not exist,
barcodes may not be unique, etc.). Additional validation is put in place
to ensure that each cryovial is identifiable.

The following validation tests will be applied when you upload a
cryovial:

1.  **Barcode uniqueness**: Cryovial barcodes should be unique by Study
and SpecimenType. Failure to meet this requirement will result in a warning
message - it will **not** block you from uploading the data.
    a.  *Message: "Barcode must be unique by Study and SpecimenType"*

2.  **Check that the dates are present if the samples are part of a
    longitudinal study.** Samples that fail will be flagged.

    a.  *Message: "Missing collection date found for sample in
        longitudinal study"*

3.  **Check that study subjects are unique within a non-longitudinal
    study.** If your upload contains a study subject that will
    introduce a duplicate into the database, the sample will be
    flagged.

    a.  *Message: \"Study subjects must be unique in studies that are
        not longitudinal\"*

4.  **Validate that study subjects and collection dates are unique for a
    longitudinal study.**

    a.  *Message: \"Study subject and collection date must be unique
        within a longitudinal study\"*

5.  **Validate the study, specimen type, and locations exist in the
    database.** Any subject with missing metadata will be flagged.
    NOTE: All of these should have been entered already in the
    "references" tab. If your samples are flagged, first look here to
    make sure your data exists in the database.

    a.  Messages:

        i.  *\"Study already exists in the database\"*

        ii. *"Specimen Type Reference Validation\"*

        iii. *"The following FreezerName, RackName, and/or RackPosition
             > are not found in the database\"*

6.  **Validate that cryovials are uploaded to empty wells.** Samples
    that are uploaded to a position shared by another cryovial will be
    flagged.

    a.  *Message: \"Uploading sample to Cryovial well location that
        already has an active sample\"*
