When you upload your file, it will be checked for any formatting issues
(ie. all expected columns are present) or validation issues (ie. a
barcode is already found in the database). The validation process will
give you as much information as possible about what needs to change in
your file. Some validation steps are dependent on others. For example,
before checking date formats, it will inform you if it cannot find the
'CollectionDate' column.

If there are validation issues, a dialog will appear listing what errors
were found. By clicking on the errors, you can view the rows that
triggered the error from your file in a table. You can additionally
download your uploaded file from this dialog with the errors included
under a new 'Errors' column. Rows with multiple errors will have both
concatenated with a semicolon (';') delimiter.

## Validation types

You may encounter `Errors` or `Warnings` if your file does not pass
validation. Errors will prevent you from performing the action you
are attempting. Warnings will appear if there are issues with your file,
but they will not prevent you from performing the action. You must
acknowledge the warning before proceeding with your upload. You will
only be allowed to acknowledge a warning once the errors have been fixed.

Below is an example of an error and a warning. They will be color coded.

You will need to address all errors before continuing with your action.
Warnings will also appear in the dialog as well. If these are not addressed,
the next time you perform your action, you will see the dialog below.

You will need to acknowledge the warning or fix the issue before proceeding.
If you acknowledge the warning, you will need to perform the action again,
but you will not see the dialog.
