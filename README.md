# Backups

SampleDB is backed up every Sunday to the Mines using `/opt/sample_db/sample_db_backup.sh` and a crontab.

<!---# The Database-->
<!---The database file that SampleDB reads and writes from is a SQLite3 file, a template for this database is provided at--> <!---`databases/sampledb_template.sqlite` or can be downloaded from--> <!---![here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1umwodPMPR0kZdsrlxTJQa-O0ylQq4tUS/view?usp=sharing).-->
<!---Copy this file to a new location on your filesystem and make it readable and writable for all users.-->
<!---Once the file is placed in a new location the path to the file needs to be saved in the `Renviron.site` file as `SDB_PATH`.-->
<!---For example...-->
<!---```-->
<!---SDB_PATH="/path/to/the/database"-->
<!---```-->

<!---The default location of `Renviron.site` is 'R_HOME/etc/Renviron.site'-->
<!---`Renviron.site` is the first file that gets read when an instance of R is spun up and variables in this file can be accessed by all R users.-->

<!---To check that `SDB_PATH` matches the path to your database file run.-->
<!---```-->
<!---Sys.getenv("SDB_PATH")-->
<!---```-->
